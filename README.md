# Carpenter Co. — Static Site

This is a minimal static prototype inspired by the Behance carpentry design you shared. Open index.html in a browser to preview.

Quick start:

```powershell
# from the project folder
# start with a simple static server (optional):
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Next steps:
- Replace photos in index.html with your project images.
- Update copy (company name, services, contact details).
- I can convert this to a WordPress theme or implement form submission handling.
